# make tab autocomplete regardless of filename case
set completion-ignore-case on

# cycle through completion suggestions with Tab (use M-? to list possible completions)
TAB:menu-complete








# TESTING --------------------------------------------------

# If there are more than 200 possible completions for a word, ask to show them all
set completion-query-items 200

# Show extra file information when completing, like `ls -F` does
set visible-stats on

# Be more intelligent when autocompleting by also looking at the text after the cursor. For example, when the current line is "cd ~/src/mozil", and the cursor is on the "z", pressing Tab will not autocomplete it to "cd ~/src/mozillail", but to "cd ~/src/mozilla". (This is supported by the Readline used by Bash 4.)
set skip-completed-text on



# NOT CURRENTLY USING (TEST BEFORE USE) ------------------------

# Allow UTF-8 input and output, instead of showing stuff like $'\0123\0456'
#set input-meta on
#set output-meta on
#set convert-meta off

# Immediately add a trailing slash when autocompleting symlinks to directories
#set mark-symlinked-directories on
